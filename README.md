# Scrapy_projects
Here I want to leave a compilation of different webscrapy projects that I have developed lately.

<h2>bianchi_scraper</h2>

Bianchi is a bicycle manufacturing company. A good friend of mine works there and part of his job was to get information from other similar companies. This information is needed to business intelligence area. I am not able to share scrapers of project itself but this is a good example of what I develop to help.

This is what I use:
- Python
- Scrapy python librarie
- xpath expression language

The result is a json file that can be used to generate a data frame and fill a data base. The json file is made up of:

- bike reference
    - bike/product link
    - modality
    - bike type
    - bike reference
    - frame
    - fork
    - headset
    - drivetrain
        - shifter
        - rear
    - brakes
        - braker
        - rotor
